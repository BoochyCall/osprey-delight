Osprey **De**light is a sugar-free version of the [awesome Osprey theme](https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey) by [Toma Nistor](https://tomanistor.com/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

> It tastes a bit different than the original (hence the *light* in the name) but also adds some new functionality to your ***delight***.
